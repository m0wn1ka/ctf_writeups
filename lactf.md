- when we try to place our cursor on it it moves
- so there is frontend scirpt which stops us
- so try it in mobile
- there is a condition to stop touching as well

- then we see there is no form to submit as well
- so the element is getted by id by the server and the corresponding function to get the flag is called

- we dont even have access to the function either
- but we can get the element by id and try to click it

- so the flag is lactf{that_button_was_definitely_not_one_of_the_terms}
